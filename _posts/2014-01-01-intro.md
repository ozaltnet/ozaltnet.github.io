# Alt.Net in Australia
When this community first got started we were a group of developers unhappy with what Microsoft was doing, their spurning of community and open source support and how their tooling encouraged and supported poor developer practices. We wanted more than that so formed a self supporting community with the aim of helping each other improve, helping each other do better and then influencing those around us.

That was back in 2008. Since then things have changed; Microsoft now embraces open source, encourages better developer practices and have taken on platform openness and all things cloud.

Even so, we're still wanting to improve how we work and the tools we use. We assess and embrace technologies outside of the .net and Microsoft spheres and believe in using the best tools for the job. We're still learning from each other, still hungry for 'better' and always wanting to be on the (b)leading edge of development practices and tools. If that sounds like you, get in touch!

We have regular user groups in Sydney and Melbourne, and this is the landing site for them.
